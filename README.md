# Linkedin-AdBlocker
Tired of sponsored content cluttering your LinkedIn feed?
So was I. That’s why I built a lightweight, privacy-first browser extension that blocks LinkedIn ads and helps you stay focused on the content that truly matters — real people and real conversations.

🔧 What it does:
✅ Removes sponsored posts from your feed
✅ Blocks sidebar ads
✅ Works seamlessly in the background
✅ No data collected — ever.

🔍 Built using:

JavaScript + DOM manipulation

Web Extension APIs

Chrome & Firefox compatibility

I made this as a weekend project to explore how browser extensions interact with the DOM and how clean, distraction-free social networking can be a game-changer.

📎 Extension is free and open source.
💬 I'd love your feedback or ideas for improvement!
